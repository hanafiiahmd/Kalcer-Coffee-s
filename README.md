# Kalcer Coffee’s Business Case Overview

Kalcer Coffee’s is a newly established coffee brand founded in 2024. As a growing business, the company is continuously expanding its customer base and operations.
Initially, the company tracked its transactions and business performance manually, which made it difficult to monitor trends, analyze sales, and make data-driven decisions.

Following a recommendation from one of its employees, Kalcer Coffee’s has decided to develop a business intelligence dashboard to track its performance and support strategic decision-making.
In addition, the company wants to analyze historical transaction data from its establishment in 2024 up to early 2025 to gain deeper insights into its business performance.
